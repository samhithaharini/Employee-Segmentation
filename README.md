# **Employee Segmentation using KNN**

Employee segmentation helps organizations understand employee behavior and performance.  
This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify employees into meaningful groups based on performance-related metrics.

---

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project performs clustering on employee data to group employees into segments such as:
- High Performers  
- Average Performers  
- Low Performers  

A clean and simple **Streamlit interface** displays the predicted segment for user inputs.

---

## **🎯 Objectives**
- Segment employees using the KNN algorithm  
- Build an interactive Streamlit app  
- Present employee categories in a clean, understandable format  
- Support HR decision-making and analytics  

---

## **🧠 Algorithm Used: KNN**
KNN clusters employees by comparing similarities in:
- Age  
- Salary  
- Projects Completed  
- Productivity (%)  

It is a simple yet powerful algorithm for segmentation tasks.

 How to Run the Project


1️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


2️⃣ Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run streamlit_app.py


3️⃣ Use the App

Enter the following details:

Age

Salary

Projects Completed

Productivity (%)

You will receive a predicted Employee Segment such as:

Cluster 0 → High Performer

Cluster 1 → Average Performer

Cluster 2 → Low Performer

(Cluster names depend on the model’s interpretation.)



 Output


The app displays:

Employee Cluster Number

Human-readable segment meaning

Clean, simple interface for HR usage


KNN Segmentation Logic


The algorithm finds the k closest employees

Uses their cluster labels

Assigns the most frequent cluster to the new employee
